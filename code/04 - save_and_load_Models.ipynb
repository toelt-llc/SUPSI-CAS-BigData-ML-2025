    "Model progress can be saved during and after training. This means a model can resume where it left off and avoid long training times. Saving also means you can share your model and others can recreate your work. When publishing research models and techniques, most machine learning practitioners share:\n",

    "* code to create the model, and\n",

    "\n",
    "There are different ways to save TensorFlow models depending on the API you're using. This guide uses [tf.keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras)â€”a high-level API to build and train models in TensorFlow. The new, high-level `.keras` format used in this tutorial is recommended for saving Keras objects, as it provides robust, efficient name-based saving that is often easier to debug than low-level or legacy formats. For more advanced saving or serialization workflows, especially those involving custom objects, please refer to the [Save and load Keras models guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/save_and_serialize). For other approaches, refer to the [Using the SavedModel format guide](../../guide/saved_model.ipynb).\n",

    "## Saving and Loading Models in Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! In Keras, a popular deep learning framework, you can save and load neural network models using the `save` and `load_model` functions. These functionalities are essential for preserving your trained models for future use or sharing them with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving a Keras Model:\n",
    "You can save a Keras model, including its architecture, weights, optimizer state, and any additional configuration, to a file using the `save` method. Typically, you'll save your model in either the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) or the TensorFlow SavedModel format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how to save a Keras model to an HDF5 file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from keras.models import Sequential\n",
    "from keras.layers import Dense\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a simple Sequential model\n",
    "model = Sequential()\n",
    "model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)))\n",
    "model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compile and train the model\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save the model to an HDF5 file\n",
    "model.save('my_model.h5')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `model.save('my_model.h5')` line will save the model and its weights to a file named \"my_model.h5\" in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading a Saved Keras Model:\n",
    "To load a saved Keras model, you can use the `load_model` function. You need to provide the path to the saved model file, and it will return the loaded model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from keras.models import load_model\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the saved model from the HDF5 file\n",
    "loaded_model = load_model('my_model.h5')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now, you can use the loaded_model for inference or further training\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to compile the loaded model with the same optimizer and loss function as before, if you plan to continue training it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you can save and load custom objects like custom layers or loss functions by providing a `custom_objects` argument when loading the model. This allows you to recreate models that include custom components correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from keras.models import load_model\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the model with custom objects\n",
    "loaded_model = load_model('my_model.h5', custom_objects={'custom_layer': custom_layer})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's how you save and load Keras models, allowing you to reuse your trained models for various tasks without retraining them from scratch."

    "## ```callbacks``` in Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "In Keras, callbacks are objects that allow you to customize and extend the behavior of your neural network model during training. Callbacks are called at different points during the training process, such as at the end of each epoch or after a batch of data is processed. They provide a way to monitor the training, make decisions based on training metrics, and even perform actions like saving the model or stopping training early.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common use cases and functionalities of callbacks in Keras:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Checkpointing:** You can use callbacks to save the model's weights and architecture at specific intervals during training. This is useful to ensure that you can restore the best model if training is interrupted or to save multiple checkpoints for later comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Early Stopping:** Callbacks can monitor a specified metric (e.g., validation loss or accuracy) and stop training early if the metric doesn't improve or starts deteriorating. This prevents overfitting and saves training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Learning Rate Scheduling:** Adjusting the learning rate during training can be crucial for better convergence. Callbacks like LearningRateScheduler allow you to change the learning rate according to a predefined schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Custom Logging:** You can create custom callbacks to log training metrics, custom loss functions, or any other information you want to track during training. This is helpful for creating detailed training logs or visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **TensorBoard Integration:** Keras provides a callback, `TensorBoard`, for integrating with TensorFlow's TensorBoard tool. TensorBoard allows you to visualize metrics, model architecture, and more during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Augmentation:** Callbacks can apply data augmentation techniques during training to artificially increase the diversity of training data and improve model generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Custom Actions:** You can implement custom actions to be taken during training, such as sending notifications, saving intermediate results, or modifying the training process based on specific conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic example of using some common callbacks in Keras:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint, EarlyStopping, TensorBoard\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define callbacks\n",
    "model_checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint('best_model.h5', save_best_only=True)\n",
    "early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5)\n",
    "tensorboard = TensorBoard(log_dir='logs')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train the model with callbacks\n",
    "history = model.fit(\n",
    "    x_train, y_train,\n",
    "    epochs=50,\n",
    "    batch_size=32,\n",
    "    validation_split=0.2,\n",
    "    callbacks=[model_checkpoint, early_stopping, tensorboard]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

The key difference between high-level `.keras`/HDF5 formats and the low-level SavedModel format is that the `.keras`/HDF5 formats uses object configs to save the model architecture, while SavedModel saves the execution graph. Thus, SavedModels are able to save custom objects like subclassed models and custom layers without requiring the original code. However, debugging low-level SavedModels can be more difficult as a result, and we recommend using the high-level `.keras` format instead due to its name-based, Keras-native nature.\n",

    "1. Define a `get_config` method in your object, and optionally a `from_config` classmethod.\n",
    "  * `get_config(self)` returns a JSON-serializable dictionary of parameters needed to recreate the object.\n",
    "  * `from_config(cls, config)` uses the returned config from `get_config` to create a new object. By default, this function will use the config as initialization kwargs (`return cls(**config)`).\n",
    "2. Pass the custom objects to the model in one of three ways:\n",
    "  - Register the custom object with the `@tf.keras.utils.register_keras_serializable` decorator. **(recommended)**\n",
    "  - Directly pass the object to the `custom_objects` argument when loading the model. The argument must be a dictionary mapping the string class name to the Python class. E.g. `tf.keras.models.load_model(path, custom_objects={'CustomLayer': CustomLayer})`\n",
    "  - Use a `tf.keras.utils.custom_object_scope` with the object included in the `custom_objects` dictionary argument, and place a `tf.keras.models.load_model(path)` call within the scope.\n",

    "# APPENDIX A - The HDF5 Format\n",
    "\n",
    "HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format version 5) is a widely used file format for storing and managing large and complex datasets or models. It was designed to address the needs of scientific and engineering applications that require efficient and flexible data storage and retrieval. HDF5 is platform-independent and supports hierarchical data structures, making it an excellent choice for storing a wide range of data types, including numerical data, images, text, and more. Here are some key characteristics and features of the HDF5 format:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hierarchical Structure:** HDF5 files are organized into a hierarchical structure, similar to a file system. They consist of groups and datasets, where groups can contain other groups or datasets. This hierarchical organization allows for logical grouping and management of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Support for Multiple Data Types:** HDF5 supports various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, compound data types, and more. This flexibility makes it suitable for storing diverse data types within the same file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Chunking:** HDF5 allows data to be stored in chunks, which can improve data access and compression efficiency. Users can define the chunk size based on their specific data access patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compression:** HDF5 provides built-in support for data compression, which can significantly reduce file size while maintaining data integrity. You can choose from several compression algorithms, such as GZIP or LZF, depending on your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Metadata:** HDF5 files can store metadata, which includes attributes and annotations that describe the data within the file. This metadata can be used to document and provide context for the stored data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Slicing:** HDF5 allows for efficient data slicing, enabling users to access and manipulate specific portions of large datasets without loading the entire dataset into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** HDF5 files are designed to be platform-independent, meaning they can be created on one platform and read on another without compatibility issues. This makes it suitable for sharing data across different operating systems and architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Language Support:** HDF5 libraries are available for various programming languages, including Python, C/C++, MATLAB, Java, and more. This wide range of language support makes it accessible to a broad user base.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Parallel I/O:** HDF5 provides support for parallel I/O, which is essential for high-performance computing applications that involve multiple processors or nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Extensibility:** HDF5 allows users to define their own data structures and data types, making it versatile for handling custom data formats and requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HDF5 Format for Keras Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format version 5) format is commonly used to store Keras models because it provides a structured way to save all the necessary information about a neural network model. When you save a Keras model in HDF5 format, you're essentially saving the model's architecture, weights, optimizer configuration, and any custom objects it may contain. Here's an overview of how Keras models are stored in HDF5 format:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Architecture:** The HDF5 file stores the complete model architecture, including all the layers and their configurations. This includes information about layer types, activation functions, input shapes, and any other relevant layer-specific settings. This information is saved in a structured manner, making it possible to reconstruct the model's architecture accurately when you load it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Weights:** The HDF5 file contains the model's weight parameters. These weights represent the learned parameters of the model, such as the weights and biases of each layer's neurons. Saving and loading weights is essential for preserving the knowledge gained during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimizer State:** If you save a model after training it, the HDF5 file includes the state of the optimizer. This includes the optimizer's configuration and the current values of all its internal variables. When you load the model, it restores the optimizer state, allowing you to continue training from where you left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Custom Objects:** If your Keras model includes custom layers, loss functions, or other custom objects, the HDF5 format allows you to save and load these custom components. However, you may need to provide a `custom_objects` dictionary when loading the model to tell Keras how to reconstruct these custom objects correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic example of how to save a Keras model in HDF5 format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from keras.models import Sequential\n",
    "from keras.layers import Dense\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a simple Sequential model\n",
    "model = Sequential()\n",
    "model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)))\n",
    "model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compile and train the model\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save the model to an HDF5 file\n",
    "model.save('my_model.h5')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To load the model later:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from keras.models import load_model\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the saved model from the HDF5 file\n",
    "loaded_model = load_model('my_model.h5')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now, you can use the loaded_model for inference or further training\n",
    "```\n"
